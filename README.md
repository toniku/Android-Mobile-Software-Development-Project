# Android-Mobile-Software-Development-Project

Android mobile application school group-project

We designed the application for the small ice hockey teams. Graphics were designed by the graphic designers. With the app user can:
- Add stats and events during the game
- Analyze players stats
- Build/design lineups
- Give feedback for the players

In this project we did accomplish our goals pretty well but the time proved to be our biggest obstacle.
