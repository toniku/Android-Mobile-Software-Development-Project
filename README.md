# Android-Mobile-Software-Development-Project

Android mobile application school group-project

We designed the application for the small ice hockey teams. The graphic designers created graphics for the app, and then software developers integrated graphics into the app. 

With the app user can:
    •	Add stats and events during the game
    •	Analyze players stats
    •	Build/design lineups
    •	Give feedback for the players
    
The application was developed with Android Studio using Java. Firebase database was used for storing the information of the user. In this project, we did accomplish our goals pretty well but time proved to be our biggest obstacle.
