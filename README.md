Android mobile application school group project

We designed the application for the small ice hockey teams. Graphics were designed by the graphic designers. 
With the app user can:
- Add stats during the game
- Adding events during the game
- Analyzing players stats 
- Building/designing lineups
- Giving feedback for the players

In this project we did accomplish our goals pretty well but the time proved to be our biggest obstacle.
