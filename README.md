# Android-Mobile-Software-Development-Project

Android mobile application school group-project

We designed the application for the small ice hockey teams. Graphics were designed by the graphic designers. With the app user can:
- Add stats and events during the game
- Analyze players stats
- Build/design lineups
- Give feedback for the players

Application was developed with Android Studio using Java and Firebase database was used for storing the information of the user. In this project we did accomplish our goals pretty well but time proved to be our biggest obstacle.
